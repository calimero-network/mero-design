/**
 * Resolving MeroDesign's own application id.
 *
 * A node can have several applications installed (curb, kv-store, MeroDesign…).
 * Picking `apps[0]` is wrong — it's whichever app happens to be first, so the
 * teams/namespaces list ends up showing another application's namespaces.
 *
 * The id is `hash(package, signer)`: it does NOT change between releases (verified
 * — two versions of the same package signed by the same key derive the same id),
 * and it is identical on every node that installs the same signed bundle. So the
 * production id is a constant here and needs no build-time configuration.
 *
 * It DOES change with the signer:
 *
 *   registry bundle (production key)      GgHNECyQqfv1n1XGjrTjNSMjmL1tQBUzWQ7k6uqsSZEZ
 *   `cargo mero bundle --dev` / dev key   a different id for the same code
 *
 * That is why the constant is a PREFERENCE checked against what the node actually
 * has, not an override: a locally dev-installed build, or a future re-signed
 * lineage, still resolves via the manifest `package` instead of failing.
 *
 * ⚠️ Deliberately NOT read from `import.meta.env.VITE_APPLICATION_ID`. That env var
 * used to outrank everything below, and a stale value configured in the hosting
 * project shipped a build pinned to `EYBVLJ…` — an id no node had — so every
 * namespace create failed with an opaque `500 Internal server error` that never
 * mentions application ids. Reading it again would reintroduce exactly that.
