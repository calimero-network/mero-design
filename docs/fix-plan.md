# Mero Design — fix plan

Every item in `IMPORTANT.md`, expanded into one shippable PR each, with the root cause traced to a
line and the e2e tests that prove it on **web and in Tauri**.

Read `PR 0` first (the test toolkit the other PRs depend on), then `PR 1` — a Fabric 7 regression
found while attempting a full design in the app, which offsets **every shape by half its own size**
and is probably the cause of several reports below. The attempt itself, and the measurements behind
that diagnosis, are in [`design-experiment.md`](./design-experiment.md).

## Why the current suite misses all 17

`app/e2e/` has 30-odd tests and they are almost all presence assertions — "the button is visible",
"the tab switches". Not one of them draws a shape and asserts what came out. A line that renders with
`strokeWidth: 0` passes every existing test. So each PR below specifies **behavioural** tests:
draw something, then assert pixels, RPC payloads, or exported bytes.

Three assertion styles are used throughout, in this order of preference:

| Style | How | Good for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Pixel probe** | `getImageData` on the Fabric canvas at a computed point | "is it actually visible", stroke colour, corner radius |
| **RPC payload** | intercept `**/jsonrpc`, read `params.argsJson` | what got persisted, and which contract method was called |
| **Export bytes** | run the export, capture the download/`invoke` args | SVG/PNG/HTML/`.merodesign` correctness |

Screenshot diffing is deliberately not used: it fails on font rendering across platforms and tells you
nothing about *why*.

## Web + Tauri, for every PR

Tauri is not a separate app — `app/src/main.tsx:37` branches on `"__TAURI_INTERNALS__" in window`,
and `tauri-app` opens this same build in a window. So the same specs must run twice, under both
environments. PR 0 adds a second Playwright project for that; from then on every spec below runs in
both unless a row says otherwise.

Only **PR 11** (file saving) has behaviour that genuinely differs between the two. Everything else
runs identically in both projects, and that is exactly the point — the Tauri project is there to
prove the fix is not silently browser-only.

# PR 0 — canvas test toolkit and a Tauri project

**Scope:** `app/e2e/fixtures/*`, `app/playwright.config.ts`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. No production
code changes.

Nothing here is a user-visible fix; every PR after it depends on it.

**What it adds**

- `e2e/fixtures/canvas.ts`
  - `drawWith(page, tool, from, to)` — click the tool, drag on the canvas, wait for the RPC.
  - `pixelAt(page, x, y)` — `[r,g,b,a]` at canvas-relative coordinates.
  - `probeSegment(page, a, b, n)` — n samples along a line; returns how many differ from the
    background. This is how "is the line visible" gets asserted without a screenshot.
  - `bgColor(page)` — the current background, so probes compare against truth rather than a constant.
- `e2e/fixtures/rpc.ts` — `recordRpc(page)` returning a live array of
  `{ method, args }`, plus `lastCall(method)`. The existing specs each re-implement a slice of this.
- `e2e/fixtures/tauri.ts` — `installTauriStub(page)`: defines `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__` with an
  `invoke(cmd, args)` that records into `window.__TAURI_CALLS__` and returns configurable results
  (mirrors `tauri-app/apps/desktop/e2e/fixtures/helpers.ts` — note the gotcha recorded there: stubbing
  the *v1* bridge makes every invoke reject, so this must stub `__TAURI_INTERNALS__`, not `__TAURI__`).
- `playwright.config.ts` — a third project, `tauri`, running the same `testMatch` as `mocked` with
  the stub installed via `use.storageState`/an init script.
- CI runs `--project=mocked` and `--project=tauri`.

**Tests (5)**

1. `pixelAt` on a freshly drawn rect returns its fill — the probe harness itself works.
2. `probeSegment` across an empty canvas returns 0 differing samples — no false positives.
3. `drawWith` produces exactly one `add_element` RPC.
4. In the `tauri` project, the app reports the Tauri branch active (login is skipped per
   `main.tsx:88`); in `mocked` it is not.
5. `installTauriStub` records an invoke round-trip and returns the configured value.

# PR 1 — Fabric 7 origin regression (do this first)

**Not in `IMPORTANT.md`** — found while attempting a full design; see
[`design-experiment.md`](./design-experiment.md) for the measurements.

**Every shape on the canvas is painted offset by half its own size**, because `app/package.json`
declares `"fabric": "^7.4.0"` and Fabric v7 changed the default object origin to **centre**, while
every coordinate in this codebase is computed as a top-left:

```
fabric 7.4.0
new Rect({ left: 100, top: 100, width: 40, height: 40 }).getBoundingRect()
  → { left: 80, top: 80 }      originX/originY → "center"/"center"
```

Measured on a real board: a 40×40 marker lands 20px up-left of its coordinates, a 76×22 chip lands
38×11 up-left. Sizes are exact, so it is neither zoom nor pan.

**Why it goes first** — it is the substrate under several other reports. A shape jumps by half its
size the instant the store syncs back (which is what "it's in the layers panel but not on the canvas"
feels like), resize handles pull against the wrong anchor (the text-resize report), and the
multi-select maths compounds the error per child. Anything fixed before this is fixed on a coordinate
system that is half a shape out.

**Fix** — set `originX: "left", originY: "top"` on the `base` object in `buildFabricObject`
(`FabricCanvas.tsx:746`) and on its text branch (`:766`); audit the interactive paths
(`:392` text placement, `:402` the IText created inline, `:461-468` the drag previews) for the same
assumption. Two lines fix the render; the audit is what makes it a PR rather than a patch.

Two more v7 changes to verify in the same pass: the default `freeDrawingBrush` was removed (PR 4), and
`IText` in v7 **does** expose `mt`/`mb` controls, so PR 6 is about anchoring, not missing controls.

**Tests (7)**

| # | Assertion |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Seed one 40×40 rect at `(100,100)`; the painted bounding box is exactly `100,100 40x40` (this is the regression, stated numerically) |
| 2 | Same for a 76×22 rect at `(712,742)` — a non-square shape, so a half-size offset cannot hide |
| 3 | Same for a circle and for a text element |
| 4 | Draw a rect interactively, wait for the store round-trip, and probe: it does **not** move between the preview and the committed object |
| 5 | Seed two rects at known coordinates; the gap between their painted edges equals the declared gap |
| 6 | Rotate an element 90°: the painted centre matches the declared centre (proves rotation still pivots correctly after the origin change) |
| 7 | Load `docs/examples/northwind.merodesign` and assert all 3 marker probes land at 0 offset — a whole-board regression test |

# PR 2 — multi-select drag

`IMPORTANT.md`: *"Can't select multiple layers at once and move them"*

**Root cause** — two independent faults:

1. `FabricCanvas.tsx:524` — `onObjectModified` starts with `if (!obj?.data?.id) return;`. When you
   drag a marquee selection, Fabric hands you an `ActiveSelection`, which has no `.data`, so the
   handler returns and **nothing is persisted**.
2. `FabricCanvas.tsx:266` — the store→canvas effect calls `fc.clear()` and rebuilds every object on
   any `elements` change, destroying the active selection mid-interaction.

**Fix** — in `onObjectModified`, detect a multi-object target, walk `getObjects()`, and convert each
child's group-relative position to absolute (`calcTransformMatrix`) before persisting one
`update_element` per child; skip the rebuild while a selection is active, or re-establish it from
`selectedElementIds` after the rebuild.

**Tests (6)**

| # | Assertion |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Draw 2 rects, marquee both, drag by (120, 60) → both elements' `x`/`y` moved by that delta (pixel probe at both new centres) |
| 2 | The drag emits **2** `update_element` RPCs, one per id |
| 3 | After the store sync completes, 2 objects are still selected (properties panel shows the multi-select state) |
| 4 | Pixel probe at both *old* centres returns background — they really moved, not copied |
| 5 | `Ctrl+Z` returns both to their original coordinates |
| 6 | Marquee-select 2 of 3 rects and drag: the third does not move |

---

# PR 3 — lines are invisible

`IMPORTANT.md`: *"Line when drawn is not displayed at all, its displayed in layer but on canvas its
height 0"*

**Root cause** — three faults stacked:

1. `FabricCanvas.tsx:512` — every new shape is created with `stroke: "transparent", strokeWidth: 0`.
   For a rect that is fine (it has a fill); for a line the stroke **is** the shape.
2. `FabricCanvas.tsx:763` — `stroke: el.stroke || "#000"` looks like a fallback but never fires:
   `el.stroke` is the string `"transparent"`, which is truthy. The line paints transparent at width 0.
3. `FabricCanvas.tsx:497` — the drag is normalised to a bounding box (`min`/`abs`), so the direction is
   lost. A line drawn bottom-left → top-right is rebuilt top-left → bottom-right on reload. The same
   normalisation clamps to `min 20`, which is where the phantom "height 20" comes from.

**Fix** — line/arrow are created with a real stroke (`#111111`, width 2) and `fill: "transparent"`;
the `|| "#000"` fallbacks are replaced with an explicit `isPaintable(colour)` check; and the two
endpoints are stored rather than a bbox. Storing endpoints needs the contract: add
`points: String` to `ElementData::Line` / `::Arrow` (`logic/src/lib.rs`), mirroring `Path`.

**Scope:** `logic/` + `app/` + a bundle republish. This is the first PR that touches the contract, so
it also carries the `min-runtime-version` correction noted in the repo's rc.20 migration.

**Tests (7)**

| # | Assertion |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Draw a line → `probeSegment` along it reports ≥80% of samples differing from background |
| 2 | The `add_element` payload has `kind: "line"`, non-empty `points`, `strokeWidth > 0`, and a stroke that is not `transparent` |
| 3 | Change the stroke colour in the properties panel → probed pixels match the new colour |
| 4 | Draw bottom-left → top-right; probe **both** diagonals: the drawn one differs from background, the mirrored one does not (direction preserved) |
| 5 | Reload with the contract returning that element → identical probe result (round-trips through `get_elements`) |
| 6 | A perfectly horizontal line has `height` 0–2, not 20 |
| 7 | Setting `strokeWidth` to 0 in the panel clamps to 1 rather than making the shape vanish |

# PR 4 — arrows have no arrowhead

`IMPORTANT.md`: *"same thing with arrow item"*

**Root cause** — `FabricCanvas.tsx:760-764`: `case "line": case "arrow":` fall through to the same
plain `Line`. There is no head geometry anywhere in the codebase. (Invisibility is PR 2; this is the
missing half.)

**Fix** — render `arrow` as a `Group([Line, Triangle])` with the head sized from `strokeWidth` and
rotated to the segment angle; teach both exporters (`toSVG`, `buildPrototypeHtml`) about it.

**Tests (5)**

| # | Assertion |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Draw an arrow → probe 3 points inside the head triangle: all differ from background |
| 2 | Probe the same 3 points for a *line* of identical geometry: all are background (the head is arrow-only) |
| 3 | SVG export of an arrow contains a `polygon`/`path` in addition to the line |
| 4 | Rotate the arrow 90° → the head is at the moved endpoint, not the origin |
| 5 | Prototype HTML export of an arrow is not a filled `div` (see PR 12) |

---

# PR 5 — the pen tool does nothing

`IMPORTANT.md`: *"pencil item does not do anything at all"*

**Root cause** — two faults:

1. `FabricCanvas.tsx:361` sets `fc.isDrawingMode = true`, but Fabric **v6 no longer creates a default
   brush**. `fc.freeDrawingBrush` is `undefined`, so drawing mode is a no-op. (This worked in v5.)
2. Even with a brush, there is no `path:created` handler — nothing would be written to the store or
   the contract.

**Fix** — construct `new PencilBrush(fc)` on init, keep its `color`/`width` in sync with the current
stroke settings, and add a `path:created` handler that serialises the path and persists it as a
`path` element (the kind and its `points` field already exist end to end).

**Tests (6)**

| # | Assertion |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Activate the pen, drag a 3-segment squiggle → `probeSegment` along each segment differs from background |
| 2 | Exactly one `add_element` RPC, `kind: "path"`, `points` non-empty and parseable as SVG path data |
| 3 | Reload from the contract → same probe result |
| 4 | `Ctrl+Z` removes the stroke (probe returns to background) |
| 5 | Switch to the select tool and drag → no new path is created (drawing mode really is off) |
| 6 | Pen stroke colour follows the panel's stroke setting, not a hardcoded black |

---

# PR 6 — layer up/down jumps to front/back

`IMPORTANT.md`: *"layers -> up and down should only do 1 up or down not front to back"*

**Root cause** — `PropertiesPanel.tsx:123-144`. The local swap is *correct* (it exchanges
`layerIndex` with the neighbour), but both handlers then call the wrong contract method:

```
handleMoveUp   → rpcCall(..., "bring_to_front")   // line 131
handleMoveDown → rpcCall(..., "send_to_back")     // line 144
```

So the UI shows a one-step move and the contract records front/back. The next sync from the contract
overwrites the local state and the element jumps. The contract has no one-step method —
`logic/src/lib.rs:721,731` are the only two ordering calls that exist.

**Fix** — add `set_layer_index(id, index)` (or `move_layer(id, delta)`) to the contract with
deterministic renumbering of the affected span, and call it from both handlers.

**Scope:** `logic/` + `app/` + bundle republish.

**Tests (6)**

| # | Assertion |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 rects, move the middle one up once → layers panel order is `1, 3, 2` |
| 2 | The RPC is `set_layer_index`/`move_layer`, and **not** `bring_to_front` (this is the regression) |
| 3 | Feed the contract's post-move ordering back through `get_elements` → order is unchanged (proves the round trip, which is what actually broke) |
| 4 | Moving the topmost element up is a no-op: no RPC, no reorder |
| 5 | Paint order matches: probe a point where two overlapping rects meet, before and after |
| 6 | `bring_to_front`/`send_to_back` buttons still jump all the way (not regressed) |

# PR 7 — text cannot be resized vertically

`IMPORTANT.md`: *"text object cant be resized up and down"*

**Root cause** — *not* missing controls: Fabric 7 does expose `mt`/`mb` on `IText` (verified
directly). The handles are there; they pull against a centre origin while `onObjectModified` writes
`left`/`top` as a corner, so the box walks away from the cursor as you drag. **PR 1 may fix most of
this on its own — re-test before writing code.** What remains after PR 1 is that `IText` has no
independent height: its box is font-derived, so a vertical drag has nothing to change.

**Fix** — switch to `Textbox` (gives width-based wrapping and a resizable box), enable `mt`/`mb`
controls, and map `scaleY` → `fontSize` on modify so the value persists as a font size rather than a
scale. `update_text_style` already carries `font_size`.

**Tests (6)**

| # | Assertion |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Select a text object → middle-top and middle-bottom handles exist at the expected coordinates |
| 2 | Drag the bottom handle down → rendered glyph height increases (probe the vertical extent of ink) |
| 3 | An `update_text_style` RPC carries the new `font_size` |
| 4 | Drag a side handle → the text re-wraps (line count increases; probe ink on the second line) |
| 5 | Reload from the contract → same size and wrap |
| 6 | `Ctrl+Z` restores the original size |

---

# PR 8 — stroke and fill ignored on images

`IMPORTANT.md`: *"stroke not working on images and fill also not working on blob images"*

**Root cause** — `FabricCanvas.tsx:276-285`: the `img.set({...})` call passes position, scale, angle,
opacity and `data` — and no `stroke`, `strokeWidth` or `fill`. The loading/unavailable placeholder
(`:293-307`) hardcodes its own colours, so `fill` cannot reach it either.

**Fix** — pass stroke/strokeWidth (with `paintFirst: "stroke"` so the border sits outside the bitmap)
to `FabricImage`; apply `el.fill` to the placeholder's backing `Rect` when it is set.

**Tests (5)**

| # | Assertion |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Add an image (mocked blob), set stroke `#ff0000` width 4 → probe just inside each edge returns red |
| 2 | Probe the image centre → still the bitmap, not overpainted |
| 3 | SVG export contains a stroke on the image node |
| 4 | While the blob is still loading, `fill` tints the placeholder |
| 5 | Reload from the contract → stroke still present |

---

# PR 9 — stroke ignored on text

`IMPORTANT.md`: *"stroke not working on text -> so maybe remove it or what"*

**Root cause** — `FabricCanvas.tsx:766-776`: the text branch passes `fill` but never `stroke`/
`strokeWidth`, so the panel's stroke control does nothing for text.

**Decision: implement it, do not remove it.** Text outlines are standard in Figma, the model already
has the fields, and every exporter already round-trips them.

**Fix** — pass `stroke`, `strokeWidth` and `paintFirst: "stroke"` to the text object; export as
`stroke`/`stroke-width` in SVG and `-webkit-text-stroke` in the prototype HTML.

**Tests (5)**

| # | Assertion |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Text with `fill: #ffffff` and `stroke: #000000` width 2 → probe finds both white and black ink |
| 2 | `strokeWidth: 0` → no black ink remains |
| 3 | SVG export has `stroke` on the `text` node |
| 4 | Prototype HTML export contains `-webkit-text-stroke` |
| 5 | Reload from the contract → stroke preserved |

# PR 10 — usernames instead of identity ids

`IMPORTANT.md`: *"Comments should have usernames displayed… not using identityID as then we dont know
who the fuck is who"* and *"In project settings we should also replace identityID's with usernames"*

**Root cause** — the data is already there: `get_members` returns `Member { id, username }`
(`logic/src/lib.rs:554`) and `update_member_username` exists. The UI simply renders the raw id:
`CommentsOverlay.tsx` (comment/reply author), `CursorsOverlay.tsx` (cursor labels), the members
dropdown in `Toolbar.tsx`, and the roles list in `SettingsModal.tsx`.

**Fix** — one `useMemberNames()` hook returning an `identity → username` map with a
short-id fallback (`abc1…f9`), consumed by all four call sites. No contract change.

**Tests (6)**

| # | Assertion |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | A comment authored by `test-identity` renders "Tester", and the raw id appears nowhere in the overlay |
| 2 | A reply shows its author's username |
| 3 | Live cursor label shows the username |
| 4 | Members dropdown lists usernames |
| 5 | Settings modal roles list shows usernames next to each role |
| 6 | An identity with no member record falls back to a shortened id and does not crash the overlay |

# PR 11 — saving PNG / SVG / `.merodesign` in Tauri

`IMPORTANT.md`: *"Save as png or as svg or as project .merodesign does not work in tauri"*

**This is the one PR where web and Tauri behaviour genuinely diverge.**

**Root cause** — `utils/export.ts:2` tries `showSaveFilePicker`, which does not exist in the Tauri
webview, then falls back to a synthetic `<a download>` click, which the webview ignores. So both
paths dead-end. `utils/projectFile.ts:41-47` does not even use that helper — it builds its own anchor,
so `.merodesign` fails the same way for a second reason.

**Fix** — a single `saveFile(bytes, filename, mime)` seam:

- Tauri → `@tauri-apps/plugin-dialog`'s `save()` for the destination, then
  `@tauri-apps/plugin-fs`'s `writeFile`. `tauri-plugin-dialog` is already a dependency of
  `tauri-app`; **the fs plugin and its capability permissions are not** and must be added there.
- Web → today's behaviour, unchanged.

Route `exportPng`, `exportSvg`, `exportSelected*` and `exportProject` through it.

Two warnings from previous Tauri file-save work in this org: `blocking_save_file` on an async command
parks a Tokio worker, and the save-destination guard was wrong four times over (cross-node paths,
case sensitivity, symlinks, dangling symlinks). Prefer the plugin's `save()` over a custom command.

**Tests — web project (4)**

| # | Assertion |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Export PNG fires a download named `merodesign-export.png` whose bytes start with the PNG magic |
| 2 | Export SVG produces `image/svg+xml` content containing `<svg` |
| 3 | Save `.merodesign` produces JSON with `version: 1` and one entry per element |
| 4 | Cancelling the picker writes nothing and surfaces no error toast |

**Tests — Tauri project (5)**

| # | Assertion |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Export PNG records `plugin:dialog|save` followed by `plugin:fs|write_file`, in that order |
| 2 | The bytes handed to `write_file` decode as a PNG of the expected dimensions |
| 3 | **No `<a download>` element is ever created** — the browser fallback must not run under Tauri |
| 4 | The stub returning `null` (user cancelled) results in no `write_file` and no error toast |
| 5 | `.merodesign` save goes through the same two invokes, not through an anchor |

**Test — `tauri-app` repo (1)**

The capability JSON grants `dialog:allow-save` and `fs:allow-write-file`. Missing permissions fail at
runtime with a rejected promise and no visible error, which is exactly how this class of bug hides.

# PR 12 — comment pins paint over navbar dropdowns

`IMPORTANT.md`: *"Comments are overlaying the navbar dropdowns"*

**Root cause** — a stacking-context trap, not a z-index number:

- `Toolbar.module.css:10` — `.toolbar { z-index: 10 }` creates a stacking context.
- `Toolbar.module.css:225,285` — the dropdowns inside it use `z-index: 200`, but that 200 only ranks
  them *within the toolbar's* context. The whole toolbar subtree still composites at 10.
- `CommentsOverlay.module.css:5,20,53` — the overlay is a sibling at 100/110/120, i.e. above the
  entire toolbar.

**Fix** — either lift the toolbar above the overlay range, or portal the dropdowns to `document.body`
so they escape the context. Portalling is the more durable answer; the z-index bump is one line.

**Tests (5)** — these must use real hit-testing, not visual inspection:

| # | Assertion |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | With a comment pin positioned under the Options dropdown, `elementFromPoint` at the overlap returns the dropdown item |
| 2 | Clicking "Export PNG" through that overlap actually exports (the pin does not swallow the click) |
| 3 | Same for the members dropdown |
| 4 | The comment popup still sits above the canvas (it must not over-correct) |
| 5 | Opening and closing the dropdown twice leaves the ordering unchanged |

# PR 13 — code export is broken in four ways

`IMPORTANT.md`: *"Images are not being embedded into html exports in code exports in prototype tag"*

The reported bug is real, and reading `buildPrototypeHtml` (`PropertiesPanel.tsx:169-198`) turned up
three more in the same function. A pasted sample of this export was reviewed separately and showed all
four symptoms at once.

**Root causes**

| Line | Fault |
| --- | --- |
| `:195` | `<img … src="" />` — the src is hardcoded empty. The reported bug. |
| `:189` | Text sets `background: ${fill}` (from `base`) **and** `color: ${fill}` → text is always invisible against its own background |
| `:197` | Line and arrow fall through to a plain `div`, so a line exports as a filled rectangle |
| `:203` | The wrapper is `position: relative` with no width/height, and coordinates are not normalised — negative `x`/`y` render off-screen and the collapsed wrapper contributes nothing |

**Fix** — embed images as data URIs from `imageCache` (falling back to a blob fetch); give text a
readable colour independent of the background; emit line/arrow as inline SVG; and translate the whole
export by its bounding-box origin, with explicit `width`/`height` on the wrapper. `border-radius` for
rects lands here too once PR 13 adds the field.

**Tests (6)**

| # | Assertion |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Export HTML for an image element → `src` starts with `data:image/` |
| 2 | Text export's `color` differs from its `background` |
| 3 | A line exports as `<svg>`/`<line>`, not a `div` with a background |
| 4 | The wrapper has non-zero `width` and `height` |
| 5 | No element has a negative `left`/`top` after normalisation |
| 6 | `page.setContent()` the exported HTML → every element's bounding box is inside the viewport and has non-zero area (renders the export and proves it is actually visible) |

# PR 14 — rounded corners

`IMPORTANT.md`: *"Ability to add rounded corners on rectangles and such"*

**Root cause** — not a bug, a missing field. `Element` (`logic/src/lib.rs`) has no corner radius, and
`FabricCanvas.tsx:758` constructs `new Rect(base)` with no `rx`/`ry`.

**Fix** — `corner_radius: Option<u32>` on the contract's `Element` and in `update_element`; `rx`/`ry`
on the Fabric object; a numeric input in the properties panel; `border-radius` in the HTML export and
`rx` in SVG. Clamp to `min(width, height) / 2`.

**Scope:** `logic/` + `app/` + bundle republish.

**Tests (6)**

| # | Assertion |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Radius 16 on a 200×120 rect → probe the corner pixel returns background while the edge midpoint returns fill |
| 2 | Radius 0 → the corner pixel returns fill (square again) |
| 3 | The `update_element` payload carries `corner_radius` |
| 4 | A radius larger than half the shorter side clamps instead of inverting the geometry |
| 5 | SVG export has `rx`; HTML export has `border-radius` |
| 6 | Reload from the contract → radius preserved |

# PR 15 — SVG icon everywhere

`IMPORTANT.md`: *"Use svg icon for bundle also for logos inside the application and as favicon.ico and
metadata"*

**Status: mostly done already.** `app/public/` already has `favicon.svg`, `favicon.ico`,
`apple-touch-icon.png`, `icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png` and `site.webmanifest`, and commit `758e70e`
("give the app a real icon in the bundle manifest and the browser") landed the manifest side. This PR
closes the remainder: the in-app `Logo` component, OG/Twitter metadata, and a check that the bundle
manifest icon actually resolves.

**Tests (5)**

| # | Assertion |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `index.html` links `favicon.svg` with `type="image/svg+xml"` |
| 2 | Every icon in `site.webmanifest` returns 200 |
| 3 | `Logo` renders inline `<svg>`, not an `<img>` to a raster |
| 4 | `logic/calimero.json` declares an icon and the referenced file exists |
| 5 | OG and Twitter card meta tags are present with a resolvable image |

| A | **`Ctrl+G` grouping is thrown away.** Grouping mutates the Fabric canvas only — no store write, no RPC — so the group disappears on the next sync from the contract, and never reaches another peer. | `FabricCanvas.tsx:606-621` adds a `Group` to the canvas and stops there | group 2 shapes → RPC persists something; after a `get_elements` sync the group survives; a second peer sees it; ungroup persists too |
| B | **Ellipses are impossible.** The circle branch takes `radius: el.width / 2` and ignores height, so a 300×80 drag renders as a 300×300 circle. | `FabricCanvas.tsx:759` | drag a wide ellipse → probe proves the rendered height matches the drag, not the width |
| C | **Duplicate `layerIndex` after deletions.** New elements take `layerIndex: elements.length`; delete one and the next insert collides with an existing index, making paint order unstable and `sort()`-dependent. | `FabricCanvas.tsx:399,513` | add 3, delete the middle, add 1 → all four indices unique; probe overlap order is stable across a reload |
| D | **Selected-SVG export can leave the canvas hidden.** It sets `visible = false` on every non-selected object, exports, then restores — with no `try`/`finally`, so a throw mid-export leaves the board blank until reload. | `FabricCanvas.tsx:147-153` | force `toSVG` to throw → all objects still visible afterwards |
| E | **A move wipes nothing but persists nothing either.** `onObjectModified` sends `fill: null, stroke: null, stroke_width: null, opacity: null` on every move. Harmless today because the contract treats null as "unchanged", but it means a move can never repair a bad style, and it is one contract change away from being destructive. | `FabricCanvas.tsx:541` | assert the payload omits style fields rather than nulling them |

# Item 18 — "go check what Figma has and implement more"

This is a roadmap, not a PR. Ordered by what a designer hits first when trying to lay out a real
screen — the experiment in `docs/design-experiment.md` was blocked by the first three.

**Tier 1 — you cannot lay out a screen without these**

1. **Frames / artboards** — a bounded page to design *in*, with clipping. Everything today floats on an
   infinite canvas with no notion of "the 1440×900 screen".
2. **Align and distribute** — align left/centre/right/top/middle/bottom, distribute spacing. Currently
   every position is hand-typed in the properties panel.
3. **Snapping and smart guides** — snap to edges, centres and equal gaps while dragging.
4. **Persisted groups** — bug A above.

**Tier 2 — the difference between a mockup and a design system**

5. Components and instances (one master, many synced copies)
6. Auto-layout (direction, gap, padding, hug/fill)
7. Shared styles and tokens for colour and type
8. Multiple pages/boards per project
9. Constraints on resize (pin left/right/centre)

**Tier 3 — polish**

10. Gradients and multiple fills; blend modes
11. Boolean operations (union, subtract, intersect)
12. Vector path editing (move/add/remove points on an existing `path`)
13. Rulers, numeric guides, a real grid
14. Export presets (1×/2×/3×, slices, per-frame export)
15. Comment threads resolved/unresolved state and mentions

Each tier-1 item is one PR with its own e2e tests, on the same pattern as above. Tiers 2 and 3 need
contract changes and should be scoped only after tier 1 lands.

# Suggested order

```
PR 0  ─ test toolkit + tauri project       (unblocks every test below)
PR 1  ─ Fabric 7 origin regression         (everything else sits on this)
│
├── PR 12 comments/dropdown z-index        (1 line, immediate relief)
├── PR 10 usernames                        (frontend only, high visibility)
├── PR 2  multi-select drag                (re-test after PR 1)

├── PR 11 Tauri file saving                (frontend + tauri-app capabilities)
└── contract wave — one bundle republish for all three:
    ├── PR 3  line visibility + direction   (adds points to Line/Arrow)
    ├── PR 6  one-step layer move           (adds set_layer_index)
    └── PR 14 corner radius                 (adds corner_radius)
        then PR 4  arrowheads               (depends on PR 3)
        then PR 15 icons                    (small, independent)
```

PR 1 goes immediately after the toolkit because three of the reports below may simply *be* it. Re-test
PR 2 and PR 7 against a patched build before writing any code for them.

The three contract PRs are grouped deliberately: each needs a WASM rebuild and a signed bundle
republish, and doing them as one wave means one republish and one `min-runtime-version` bump instead
of three.
